Very goodlooking graphics and challenging AI is what youâll get playing this version of Renju. Renju is built around PureMVC framework a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic Model-View-Controller design meta-pattern. You may think this game â with fancy graphics, advanced AI and framework programming â should be protected, encrypted and whatever, butâŚ ActionScript Notes owner released the source codeâŚ a priceless gift for us programmers. Download this AS3 pearl and give the author some feedback, and donât forget to visit ActionScript Notes where you will find, among other interesting things, a Flash Mac Style Flash Menu with full source code. Great job! by Emanuele Feronato March 25, 2008
